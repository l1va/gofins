# GoFINS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/l1va/gofins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/l1va/gofins)

This is fins command client written by Go.

The library support communication to omron PLC from Go application.

Ideas were taken from https://github.com/hiroeorz/omron-fins-go and https://github.com/patrick--/node-omron-fins

Library was tested with <b>Omron PLC NJ501-1300</b>. Mean time of the cycle request-response is 4ms.
Additional work in the siyka-au repository was tested against a CP1L-EM.

Feel free to ask questions, raise issues and make pull requests!

<b>PS. Build is ok</b> but Travis is randomly failing to run tests with <b>go 1.10</b>
(with earlier go versions tests are passed too): [travis](https://travis-ci.org/l1va/gofins)
